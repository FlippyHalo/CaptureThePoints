CaptureThePoints
==========

_Status of this branch's builds: **TESTING**_ http://graywolfsolutions.com:8080/job/CaptureThePoints/

### Branch: newArenas ###
* The way we handle more than one arena will be improved
* Joining arenas will be done with `/ctp j <arena>`

### Update: 1.5.0 ###
* Add custom events
* - CTPEndEvent
* - CTPPlayerDeathEvent
* - CTPPlayerJoinEvent
* - CTPPlayerLeaveEvent
* - CTPPointCaptureEvent
* - CTPShopPurchaseEvent
* - CTPStartEvent
* Force clients to get the sign updates that we do when restoring an arena, thanks to Bubelbub
* Revamped how multiple arenas are handled
* Recoded ~40% of the plugin, should have better performance
* Changed some commands to fix the new system
* - `/ctp j <arena>` if no `<arena>` is given, we will send them to the default arena or the one arena (if there is only one)
* - `/ctp kick <arena> <player`
* - `/ctp start <arena>`
* - `/ctp colors <arena>` if no `<arena>` is given, it will list out all your arenas for you.
* Fixed a bug that could allow for glitching out items
* Fixed a bug where if you set the maxPlayerHealth to something above 20 the plugin would throw an error
* Fixed a bug that allowed users to teleport out of the lobby using ender pearls.
* Fixed the default allowBlockBreak being set to true, now is false.
* Fixed the default allowBlockPlace being set to true, now is false.
* Added a config option to allow explosions breaking blocks, defaults to false
* Added eggs are grenades if enabled in the config.
* - Configurable per arena
* - Power is configurable per arena


### Update: 1.4.5 ###
* Rewrote how potions are handled completely, let craftbukkit do it for us.
* Rewrote several classes and moved things around to be organized in the code.
* Removed a bunch of commented out code, if you want it back look up the stuff in the github history prior to this commit.
* Removed as many storing of player instances as I can see atm, __I probably did break the plugin__
* Made when we setHealth to trigger a new regain health event, although I'm still finding these throughout the plugin.
* Made it so that when you first load the plugin (or you haven't made any arenas yet) it doesn't automatically generate an Arenas.yml file in the Arenas folder which in the past would throw errors and confuse you.
* Fixed permissions not being used
* Fixed the random chance of everyone getting ctp.admin node, now only ops get it
* Fixed the plugin not respecting unix hidden files, thanks to Psithief
* Fixed a lot of NPEs that only occur on the first run of the plugin
* Fixed a couple NPEs being thrown when there weren't any arenas (still finding some more)
* Fixed a NPE thrown when trying to balance teams when there are no players.
* Fixed a NPE thrown when we try to restore role items but a player has taken off their armor
* Added an option to disallow regenerating health due to their hunger bar being satisfied
* Added a message of how many arenas were loaded.
* Added an option to allow players to break their own wool in a point they have captured.
* Added a command to change the amount of points needed to win
* Cleaned up how messages are logged to the console
* Cleaned up the formatting of sending messages to the players, now the same across the plugin
